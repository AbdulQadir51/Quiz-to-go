# Quiz-to-go
Testing our skills
Putting my skills to test I created this demo quiz with applying all the acceptance criteria.

So if to attempt thi demo  code quiz
**First thing you need to do is to click the start button**
Then a timer will start and you will be presented with a question
When you  answer the question
Then you wil be presented with another question
When you answer a question incorrectly
Then  time will  subtracted from the clock
Or if all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
Then  the quiz  is over
When the quiz is over
Then you can save your initials and score
